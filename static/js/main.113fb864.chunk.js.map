She has recently returned to SFSU to receive her teaching credential in Music Education, which she completed in Spring 2014. During her time at SFSU, Ms. Dominguez has been a member of Women’s Chorus, University Chorus and Chamber Singers. She also has enjoyed the Opera Workshops, performing in scenes including Don Pasquale, The Medium, La Bohème, and Le Nozze di Figaro, accompanied by the SFSU Orchestra. She has enjoyed being apart of a recent production of Lamplighter’s Iolanthe.</p>\n            <p>Bianca is a music instructor at her home studio, and a resident artist with Spindrift School of the Performing Arts, teaching private voice and piano lessons. She was the vocal coach for Terra Nova High School’s production of Grease in Spring 2013. Bianca is a music director for SSPA summer camp, Broadway Bound. Bianca has also assistant directed youth choirs, including the Hip Kids of San Francisco’s Inspire Music, where she also is an instructor.  Bianca completed her student teaching with the fine musicians of Hillsdale High School, in San Mateo; working with the choir and orchestra classNamees. Currently Ms. Dominguez is enjoying her first year teaching Elementary Music full-time in the Mount Diablo Unified School District. Her students range from 1st through 5th grade, and she finds her work of sharing music and creativity extremely rewarding.</p>\n            <p>Bianca is thrilled to have such an amazing studio of students, and to be apart of such great teaching opportunities, that continue to inspire her passion for music.\n              </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section >\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default About;","import React from 'react';\nimport img from '../img/web_Bianca-27-Edit.jpg'\n\nconst Lessons = ({ }) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <section\n        className=\"module module-header bg-dark bg-dark-50\"\n        id=\"lessons\"\n        style={{\n          backgroundPosition: '90% 15%;'\n        }}>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3\">\n              <h1 className=\"module-title font-alt align-center\">Lessons</h1>\n              <div className=\"module-subtitle font-inc align-center\">\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section >\n      <section className=\"module\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-12\">\n              <h2 className=\"module-title font-alt\">About Lessons</h2>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-12\">\n              <div>\n                Voice lessons support student musicians in learning to use their voices in a safe way so that they may develop a full and even range. One of the most important benefits of engaging a voice teacher is to have a professional ear assess the technique and vocal health of a singer. While our instrument, the voice, is very accessible, our physical structure makes it challenging for a singer to hear how they are really singing. (For example, consider hearing your voice in a message or video, and thinking: \"Is that what I sound like?!\") A vocal instructor helps musicians navigate singing through sensation--acting as true ears, ready to redirect, and support growing voices at any age and experience level.\n              </div>\n              <br />\n              <div>\n                Whether students choose to study voice or piano, Ms. Dominguez incorporates elements of music literacy into every lesson, including building sight reading and ear training skills through various exercises. Vocal students solfege in their exercises regularly to build their familiarity of the syllables and intervals. Piano students preparing for CA Certificate of Merit evaluations will dedicate larger portions of their lesson time to completing theory studies, but will be expected to continue their work at home.\n               </div>\n              <br />\n              <div>\n                Practice notes, focus points and assignments are listed during the lessons to help reinforce weekly goals, for students (and parents) to refer to at home. Occasionally further supports, either videos or recordings, are captured and shared with students to review during practice. The studio is equipped with Abelton Live software, so that in some lessons, students record pieces to share successful musical performances. Students may also learn how to prepare resumes and headshots as well as audition practice.\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"col-sm-12\">\n              <h3>Voice Lessons are divided into time for</h3>\n              <ul className=\"lists\">\n                <li>exercises and warm-ups</li>\n                <li>building basic musicianship skills</li>\n                <li>learning and performing repertoire</li>\n              </ul>\n              <h3>Piano Lessons are divided into time for</h3>\n              <ul className=\"lists\">\n                <li>scales and finger strength building exercises</li>\n                <li>musicianship skills</li>\n                <li>learning and performing repertoire</li>\n                <li>music theory instruction</li>\n              </ul>\nCombination lessons are encouraged, and are perfect for the beginning musician.

Students are rewarded individually for brave positive participation, classmate encouragement and respectful attitudes; exemplary classes are rewarded through school-wide based systems. Each grade level has at least one performance during the year. Both schools have just presented fantastic and well received December 2014 concerts, Songs for Our Winter, featuring the 2nd and 4th Grade students.</p>\n              <p>With such a large student population across a wide range of skill levels, Ms. Dominguez collaborates regularly with colleagues in the district, sharing and creating new lessons for all elementary students within the MDUSD.
